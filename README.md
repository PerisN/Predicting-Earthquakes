# Predicting-Earthquakes
A machine learning model for predicting earthquakes based on seismic data.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the occurrence of earthquakes. The model will be trained on a dataset of seismic activity and will make predictions based on the patterns and relationships found in the data.
